We identified neuron types by colocalizing Ca2+ signals of a red-fluorescing indicator with genetically encoded markers. We reconstructed firing rate changes from Ca2+ signals by temporal deconvolution. This technique is efficient, dramatically enhances temporal resolution, facilitates data interpretation and permits analysis of odor-response patterns across thousands of neurons in the zebrafish olfactory bulb. Hence, temporally deconvolved Ca2+ imaging (TDCa imaging) resolves limitations of current optical recording techniques and is likely to be widely applicable because of its simplicity, robustness and generic principle.},

Functionality of this package includes correction of motion artifacts occurring during in vivo imaging with laser-scanning microscopy, segmentation of imaged ﬁelds into regions of interest (ROIs), and extraction of signals from the segmented ROIs. We have also developed a graphical user interface (GUI) for manual editing of the automatically segmented ROIs and automated registration of ROIs across multiple imaging datasets. This software has been designed with ﬂexibility in mind to allow for future extension with different analysis methods and potential integration with other packages.

We used in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to independently map ON and OFF receptive field subregions of local populations of layer 2/3 neurons in mouse visual cortex. Receptive field subregions were often precisely shared among neighboring neurons. Furthermore, large subregions seem to be assembled from multiple smaller, non-overlapping subregions of other neurons in the same local population. These experiments provide, to our knowledge, the first characterization of the diversity of receptive fields in a dense local network of visual cortex and reveal elementary units of receptive field organization. Our results suggest that a limited pool of afferent receptive fields is available to a local population of neurons and reveal new organizational principles for the neural circuitry of the mouse visual cortex.},

This constraint helps us to incorporate the effect of dye-bleaching and reduce the non-uniqueness of the solution. We demonstrate that in the case of noisy data, the NMF algorithm can detect cells more accurately than Mukamel’s independent component analysis algorithm, a state-of-art method. We then apply the NMF algorithm to Ca2+ imaging data recorded on the local activities of subcellular structures of multiple cells in a wide area. We show that our method can decompose rapid transient components corresponding to somas and dendrites of many neurons, and furthermore, that it can decompose slow transient components probably corresponding to glial cells.},

Searching for somata in artificial in vivo data, our algorithm achieved better performance than human annotators. SeNeCA copes well with uneven background brightness and in-plane motion artifacts, the major problems in simple segmentation methods. In the fast mode, artificial in vivo images with a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels containing ≈ 100 neurons can be processed at a rate up to 175 frames per second (tested on Intel i7, 8 threads, magnetic hard disk drive). This speed of a segmentation algorithm could bring new possibilities into the field of in vivo optophysiology. With such a short latency (down to 5-6 ms on an ordinary personal computer) and using some contemporary optogenetic tools, it will allow experiments in which a control program can continuously evaluate the occurrence of a particular spatial pattern of activity (a possible correlate of memory or cognition) and subsequently inhibit/stimulate the entire area of the circuit or inhibit/stimulate a different part of the neuronal system.

A fundamental challenge in calcium imaging has been to infer spike rates of neurons from the measured noisy fluorescence traces. We systematically evaluate different spike inference algorithms on a large benchmark dataset (\&gt;100,000 spikes) recorded from varying neural tissue (V1 and retina) using different calcium indicators (OGB-1 and GCaMP6). In addition, we introduce a new algorithm based on supervised learning in flexible probabilistic models and find that it performs better than other published techniques. Importantly, it outperforms other algorithms even when applied to entirely new datasets for which no simultaneously recorded data is available. Future data acquired in new experimental conditions can be used to further improve the spike prediction accuracy and generalization performance of the model. Finally, we show that comparing algorithms on artificial data is not informative about performance on real data, suggesting that benchmarking different methods with real-world datasets may greatly facilitate future algorithmic developments in neuroscience.},

The state-of-the art single-wavelength GECI, GCaMP3, has been deployed in a number of model organisms and can reliably detect three or more action potentials in short bursts in several systems in vivo. Through protein structure determination, targeted mutagenesis, high-throughput screening, and a battery of in vitro assays, we have increased the dynamic range of GCaMP3 by severalfold, creating a family of "GCaMP5" sensors. We tested GCaMP5s in several systems: cultured neurons and astrocytes, mouse retina, and in vivo in Caenorhabditis chemosensory neurons, Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction and adult antennal lobe, zebrafish retina and tectum, and mouse visual cortex. Signal-to-noise ratio was improved by at least 2- to 3-fold. In the visual cortex, two GCaMP5 variants detected twice as many visual stimulus-responsive cells as GCaMP3. By combining in vivo imaging with electrophysiology we show that GCaMP5 fluorescence provides a more reliable measure of neuronal activity than its predecessor GCaMP3. GCaMP5 allows more sensitive detection of neural activity in vivo and may find widespread applications for cellular imaging in general.},

Using structure-based mutagenesis and neuron-based screening, we developed a family of ultrasensitive protein calcium sensors (GCaMP6) that outperformed other sensors in cultured neurons and in zebrafish, flies and mice in vivo. In layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mouse visual cortex, GCaMP6 reliably detected single action potentials in neuronal somata and orientation-tuned synaptic calcium transients in individual dendritic spines. The orientation tuning of structurally persistent spines was largely stable over timescales of weeks. Orientation tuning averaged across spine populations predicted the tuning of their parent cell. Although the somata of GABAergic neurons showed little orientation tuning, their dendrites included highly tuned dendritic segments (5-40-µm long). GCaMP6 sensors thus provide new windows into the organization and dynamics of neural circuits over multiple spatial and temporal scales.},

Using two-photon calcium imaging in vivo and intracellular recordings in vitro, we investigated the dependencies between synaptic connectivity, feature selectivity and network activity in pyramidal cells and fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons in mouse visual cortex. In pyramidal cell populations, patterns of neuronal correlations were largely stimulus-dependent, indicating that their responses were not strongly dominated by functionally biased recurrent connectivity. By contrast, visual stimulation only weakly modified co-activation patterns of fast-spiking PV cells, consistent with the observation that these broadly tuned interneurons received very dense and strong synaptic input from nearby pyramidal cells with diverse feature selectivities. Therefore, feedforward and recurrent network influences determine the activity of excitatory and inhibitory ensembles in fundamentally different ways.},

Simultaneous intracellular recording and two-photon calcium imaging confirm that fluorescence activity is linearly proportional to neuronal spiking activity across a wide range of firing rates (10 Hz to 150 Hz). By providing two-photon imaging access to cortical neuronal populations at single-cell or single dendritic spine resolution in awake monkeys, the techniques reported can help bridge the use of modern genetic and molecular tools and the study of higher cognitive function.},

It can reveal information about the location of various calcium channels and calcium permeable receptors, the time course, magnitude, and location of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) changes, and indirectly, the occurrence of action potentials. Dynamic sodium imaging, a less exploited technique, can reveal analogous information related to sodium signaling. In some cases, like the examination of AMPA and NMDA receptor signaling, measurements of both [Ca2+]i and [Na+]i changes in the same preparation may provide more information than separate measurements. To this end, we developed a technique to simultaneously measure both signals at high speed and sufficient sensitivity to detect localized physiologic events. This approach has advantages over sequential imaging because the preparation may not respond identically in different trials. We designed custom dichroic and emission filters to allow the separate detection of the fluorescence of sodium and calcium indicators loaded together into a single neuron in a brain slice from the hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats. We then used high-intensity light emitting diodes (LEDs) to alternately excite the two indicators at the appropriate wavelengths. These pulses were synchronized with the frames of a CCD camera running at 500 Hz. Software then separated the data streams to provide independent sodium and calcium signals. With this system we could detect [Ca2+]i and [Na+]i changes from single action potentials in axons and synaptically evoked signals in dendrites, both with submicron resolution and a good signal-to-noise ratio (S/N).},

	abstract = {Although Hodgkin and Huxley had no knowledge of the physical nature of the conductance mechanisms underlying action potentials, they nonetheless proposed that nerve cell membranes have channels that allow ions to pass selectively from one side of the membrane to the other (see Chapter 3). Based on the ionic conductances and currents measured in voltage clamp experiments, the postulated channels had to have several properties. First, because the ionic currents are quite large, the channels had to be capable of allowing ions to move across the membrane at high rates. Second, because the ionic currents depend on the electrochemical gradient across the membrane, the channels had to make use of these gradients. Third, because Na+ and K+ flow across the membrane independently of each other, different channel types had to be capable of discriminating between Na+ and K+, allowing only one of these ions to flow across the membrane under the relevant conditions. Finally, given that the conductances are voltage-dependent, the channels had to be able to sense the voltage drop across the membrane, opening only when the voltage reached appropriate levels. While this concept of channels was highly speculative in the 1950s, later experimental work established beyond any doubt that transmembrane proteins called voltage-sensitive ion channels indeed exist and are responsible for all of the ionic conductance phenomena described in Chapter 3.},

	abstract = {The proper functioning of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is crucial for multiple cellular activities and survival. Disturbances in the normal ER functions lead to the accumulation and aggregation of unfolded proteins, which initiates an adaptive response, the unfolded protein response (UPR), in order to regain normal ER functions. Failure to activate the adaptive response initiates the process of programmed cell death or apoptosis. Apoptosis plays an important role in cell elimination, which is essential for embryogenesis, development, and tissue homeostasis. Impaired apoptosis can lead to the development of various pathological conditions, such as neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, cancer, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Calcium (Ca2+) is one of the key regulators of cell survival and it can induce ER stress-mediated apoptosis in response to various conditions. Ca2+ regulates cell death both at the early and late stages of apoptosis. Severe Ca2+ dysregulation can promote cell death through apoptosis. Action potential, an electrical signal transmitted along the neurons and muscle fibers, is important for conveying information to, from, and within the brain. Upon the initiation of the action potential, increased levels of cytosolic Ca2+ (depolarization) lead to the activation of the ER stress response involved in the initiation of apoptosis. In this review, we discuss the involvement of Ca2+ and action potential in ER stress-mediated apoptosis.},

To constrain and test computational models, researchers need access to a wide variety of experimental data. Much of those data are not readily accessible because neuroscientists fall into separate communities that study the brain at different levels and have not been motivated to provide data to researchers outside their community. To foster sharing of neuroscience data, a workshop was held in 2007, bringing together experimental and theoretical neuroscientists, computer scientists, legal experts and governmental observers. Computational neuroscience was recommended as an ideal field for focusing data sharing, and specific methods, strategies and policies were suggested for achieving it. A new funding area in the NSF/NIH Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) program has been established to support data sharing, guided in part by the workshop recommendations. The new funding area is dedicated to the dissemination of high quality data sets with maximum scientific value for computational neuroscience. The first round of the CRCNS data sharing program supports the preparation of data sets which will be publicly available in 2008.

Even for local neural circuits, a comprehensive description of network activity has been impossible so far. Here we demonstrate that two-photon calcium imaging of bulk-labeled tissue permits dissection of local input and output activities in rat neocortex in vivo. Besides astroglial and neuronal calcium transients, we found spontaneous calcium signals in the neuropil that were tightly correlated to the electrocorticogram. This optical encephalogram (OEG) is shown to represent bulk calcium signals in axonal structures, thus providing a measure of local input activity. Simultaneously, output activity in local neuronal populations could be derived from action potential-evoked calcium transients with single-spike resolution. By using these OEG and spike activity measures, we characterized spontaneous activity during cortical Up states. We found that (i) spiking activity is sparse ({\textless}0.1 Hz); (ii) on average, only ≈10\% of neurons are active during each Up state; (iii) this active subpopulation constantly changes with time; and (iv) spiking activity across the population is evenly distributed throughout the Up-state duration. Furthermore, the number of active neurons directly depended on the amplitude of the OEG, thus optically revealing an input-output function for the local network. We conclude that spontaneous activity in the neocortex is sparse and heterogeneously distributed in space and time across the neuronal population. The dissection of the various signal components in bulk-loaded tissue as demonstrated here will enable further studies of signal flow through cortical networks.},

We have developed tools for analyzing in vivo multiphoton data sets to identify responding structures and events in single cells as well as patterns of activity within the neural ensemble. Data were analyzed from populations of cerebellar Purkinje cell dendrites, which generate calcium-based complex action potentials. For image segmentation, active dendrites were identified using a correlation-based method to group covarying pixels. Firing events were extracted from dendritic fluorescence signals with a 95\% detection rate and an 8\% false-positive rate. Because an event that begins in one movie frame is sometimes not detected until the next frame, detection delays were compensated using a likelihood-based correction procedure. To identify groups of dendrites that tended to fire synchronously, a k-means-based procedure was developed to analyze pairwise correlations across the population. Because repeated runs of k-means often generated dissimilar clusterings, the runs were combined to determine a consensus cluster number and composition. This procedure, termed meta-k-means, gave clusterings as good as individual runs of k-means, was independent of random initial seeding, and allowed the exclusion of outliers. Our methods should be generally useful for analyzing multicellular activity recordings in a variety of brain structures.},

	abstract = {Activity in populations of neurons is essential for cortical function including signaling of information and signal transport. Previous methods have made advances in recording activity from many neurons but have both technical and analytical limitations. Here we present an optical method, dithered random-access functional calcium imaging, to record somatic calcium signals from up to 100 neurons, in vitro and in vivo. We further developed a maximum-likelihood deconvolution algorithm to detect spikes and precise spike timings from the recorded calcium fluorescence signals. Spike detection efficiency and spike timing detection was determined in acute slices of juvenile mice. The results indicate that the combination of the two methods detected precise spiking activity from unbiased and spatially distributed populations of neurons in acute slices with high efficiency of spike detection ({\textgreater}97\%), low rate of false positives (0.0023 spikes/s), and high temporal precision. The results further indicate that there is only a small window of excitation intensities where high spike detection can be achieved consistently.},

Taking advantage of the fact that action potentials reliably evoke transient calcium fluctuations in the cell body, functional multineuron calcium imaging (fMCI) monitors the suprathreshold activity of hundreds of neurons. However, a limitation of fMCI is its semi-manual procedure of spike extraction from somatic calcium fluctuations, which is not only time consuming but is also associated with human errors. Here we describe a novel automatic method that combines principal-component analysis and support vector machine. This simple algorithm determines the timings of the spikes in calcium fluorescence traces more rapidly and reliably than human operators.},

In validation studies using simulated data, automated sorting significantly improved estimation of cellular signals compared to conventional analysis based on image regions of interest. We used automated procedures to analyze data recorded by two-photon Ca(2+) imaging in the cerebellar vermis of awake behaving mice. Our analysis yielded simultaneous Ca(2+) activity traces for up to {\textgreater}100 Purkinje cells and Bergmann glia from single recordings. Using this approach, we found microzones of Purkinje cells that were stable across behavioral states and in which synchronous Ca(2+) spiking rose significantly during locomotion.},

	abstract = {As recent advances in calcium sensing technologies facilitate simultaneously imaging action potentials in neuronal populations, complementary analytical tools must also be developed to maximize the utility of this experimental paradigm. Although the observations here are fluorescence movies, the signals of interest--spike trains and/or time varying intracellular calcium concentrations--are hidden. Inferring these hidden signals is often problematic due to noise, nonlinearities, slow imaging rate, and unknown biophysical parameters. We overcome these difficulties by developing sequential Monte Carlo methods (particle filters) based on biophysical models of spiking, calcium dynamics, and fluorescence. We show that even in simple cases, the particle filters outperform the optimal linear (i.e., Wiener) filter, both by obtaining better estimates and by providing error bars. We then relax a number of our model assumptions to incorporate nonlinear saturation of the fluorescence signal, as well external stimulus and spike history dependence (e.g., refractoriness) of the spike trains. Using both simulations and in vitro fluorescence observations, we demonstrate temporal superresolution by inferring when within a frame each spike occurs. Furthermore, the model parameters may be estimated using expectation maximization with only a very limited amount of data (e.g., approximately 5-10 s or 5-40 spikes), without the requirement of any simultaneous electrophysiology or imaging experiments.},

These signals are detectable without averaging, and the signal-to-noise is sufficient to carry out a reconstruction of the spiking pattern of hundreds of neurons, up to relatively high firing frequencies.

Further, current activity extraction methods are typically applied to imaging data after the experiment is complete. However, in many cases we would prefer to run closed-loop experiments—analyzing data on-the-fly to guide the next experimental steps or to control feedback—and this requires new methods for accurate real-time processing. Here we present a fast activity extraction algorithm addressing both issues. Our approach follows previous work in casting the activity extraction problem as a sparse nonnegative deconvolution problem. To solve this optimization problem, we introduce a new algorithm that is an order of magnitude faster than previous methods, and progresses through the data sequentially from beginning to end, thus enabling, in principle, real-time online estimation of neural activity during the imaging session. This computational advance thus opens the door to new closed-loop experiments.},

	abstract = {The last several years have seen the emergence of datasets of an unprecedented scale, and solving various inference problems on such datasets has received much focus in the modern machine learning and statistics literature. Understanding the statistical and computational aspects of learning from these large and high-dimensional datasets is the key focus of this thesis. One source of such data is the virtually unbounded amounts of unstructured information on the internet, which can often be compiled into large datasets for training machine learning algorithms using automated techniques, computer vision, natural language tasks, and web search and ranking being prime examples. Computational biology, computational astronomy and collaborative filtering are some other examples of problem domains where vast amounts of training data for learning algorithms are often readily available.

It might be expected that the large number of samples make the statistical problem easier, and subsampling a smaller dataset should be an effective computational strategy. However, this is not always the case. With access to more and more data, the goal is often to understand higher order dependencies in the data, leading to an explosion in the number of parameters to be estimated. Indeed a large body of literature in modern machine learning and statistics is focusing on problems where the number of parameters grows with, and is often larger than the number of samples.

While the number of training samples and parameters seems to grow almost unboundedly, computation is struggling to keep up. The last few years have seen a clear tapering off in the rate of growth of computational power on individual cores. As a result, the algorithmic focus in machine learning has shifted to online and stochastic optimization algorithms, budgeted learning algorithms and parallel and distributed algorithms fit for multicore, cluster or cloud environments.

Though it might seem that computation is the main bottleneck for such massive data problems, it is not appropriate to consider these problems as purely computational and ignore the underlying statistical structure. In fact, in many cases the statistical nature of the data can make the computational problem easier, and make the goals of computation simpler than needed without this structure. As a result, a fundamental question in modern statistics and machine learning is to understand the error of statistical estimators, as a function of the sample size, number of parameters and the computational budget available.

The goal of this thesis is to study these trade-offs between the computational and statistical aspects of learning problems. This line of research results in several natural questions, some of which are partially addressed in this thesis and others present interesting challenges for future work.},

This technique can be used to elucidate the interaction between a drug and a specific ion channel at different conformational states to understand the ion channel modulators’ mechanisms. The patch clamp technique is regarded as a gold standard for ion channel research; however, it suffers from low throughput and high personnel costs. In the last decade, the development of several automated electrophysiology platforms has greatly increased the screen throughput of whole cell electrophysiological recordings. New advancements in the automated patch clamp systems have aimed to provide high data quality, high content, and high throughput. However, due to the limitations noted above, automated patch clamp systems are not capable of replacing manual patch clamp systems in ion channel research. While automated patch clamp systems are useful for screening large amounts of compounds in cell lines that stably express high levels of ion channels, the manual patch clamp technique is still necessary for studying ion channel properties in some research areas and for specific cell types, including primary cells that have mixed cell types and differentiated cells that derive from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) or embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Therefore, further improvements in flexibility with regard to cell types and data quality will broaden the applications of the automated patch clamp systems in both academia and industry.},
